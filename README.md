# Login-App
##This is the simple login app.
**I made this login app using passportjs module and in this project the user can signup and when user signup or login i redirect the user to a secret page.
**When the user got logout from the site and after that if user try to see the secret page then without login the user cann't see that.
**And for the designing i am using the google materialize css framework.
